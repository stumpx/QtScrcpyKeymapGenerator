# Keymapper Generator for QTScrcpy - https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy
- Upload a screenshot of the controls from the game
- customize each map key
- get the result in the form of json

# limitation
- there is a problem in accuracy
- only a few key types are available


I do not know if there are already available third party applications for customization of the keyboard and mouse so I created this to help organize the layout


I'm learning React JS so I made this an exercise and the result is of course messy
